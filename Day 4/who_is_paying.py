# Day 4 - Second exercise.


# Who's Paying

# Instructions

# You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.
# Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.
# Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, 
#           you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name


# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. \n")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
#list_name = {names.random(1, 5)}
import random
len_list = len(names)
print(len_list)
print(f"{names[random.randint(0, len_list - 1)]} is going to buy the meal today!")
